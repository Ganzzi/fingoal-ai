# Epic 6: Real-time Notifications

**Goal:** Build a standalone Node.js notification server with Socket.IO integration that can send real-time alerts to the Flutter app, triggered by n8n HTTP nodes for proactive financial monitoring.

---

## **Story 6.1: Node.js Notification Server**
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** a dedicated notification server that can handle real-time messaging,
**so that** users receive immediate alerts about important financial events.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A standalone Node.js server with Express.js framework.
2. Socket.IO integration for real-time bidirectional communication.
3. RESTful API endpoints for triggering notifications from n8n workflows:
   - `POST /api/notify/user/{user_id}` - Send notification to specific user
   - `POST /api/notify/broadcast` - Send notification to all users
   - `GET /api/notify/status` - Server health check
4. Authentication middleware to validate requests from n8n workflows.
5. Connection management for tracking active user sessions.
6. Message queuing for offline users (store notifications for delivery when they reconnect).
7. Logging and monitoring capabilities.

## **Story 6.2: Flutter Socket.IO Integration**
**As a** Flutter App,
**I want** to connect to the notification server and receive real-time updates,
**so that** users get immediate alerts without polling the server.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Socket.IO client integration in Flutter using `socket_io_client` package.
2. Automatic connection management with reconnection logic.
3. User authentication with the notification server using JWT tokens.
4. Event handlers for different notification types:
   - Budget alerts (overspending warnings)
   - Goal achievements and milestones
   - Payment due reminders
   - Market alerts for investments
   - Security alerts for account changes
5. Connection state management (connected, disconnected, reconnecting).
6. Notification persistence for app background/foreground states.
7. Graceful handling of connection failures and network issues.

## **Story 6.3: N8N Notification Triggers**
**As an** AI Agent,
**I want** to trigger real-time notifications through HTTP requests to the notification server,
**so that** users receive immediate alerts about important financial events.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. HTTP Request nodes added to relevant n8n workflows (Monitor Agent, Analyzer Agent).
2. Standardized notification payload format:
   - `user_id`: Target user for the notification
   - `type`: Notification category (alert, achievement, reminder, info)
   - `title`: Notification headline
   - `message`: Detailed notification content
   - `priority`: Notification importance (low, normal, high, urgent)
   - `action_url`: Optional deep link for user action
   - `expires_at`: Optional expiration time
3. Error handling for notification server unavailability.
4. Notification deduplication to prevent spam.
5. User preference checks before sending notifications.
6. **Reference:** Use HTTP patterns from `docs/n8n_config_creation_instructions/5-http-and-api-nodes.md`

## **Story 6.4: Notification UI Components**
**As a** User,
**I want** to see notifications displayed beautifully in the app with appropriate actions,
**so that** I can quickly understand and respond to important financial alerts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. In-app notification overlay system with different display styles:
   - Toast notifications for low-priority alerts
   - Modal dialogs for high-priority alerts
   - Banner notifications for ongoing issues
2. Notification center/inbox for viewing all notifications:
   - Categorized by type and priority
   - Mark as read/unread functionality
   - Archive and delete options
   - Search and filter capabilities
3. Rich notification content support:
   - Icons and colors based on notification type
   - Action buttons for quick responses
   - Deep linking to relevant app sections
4. Notification sound and vibration patterns based on priority.
5. Do Not Disturb mode and quiet hours settings.
6. Notification analytics (delivery, open rates, actions taken).
