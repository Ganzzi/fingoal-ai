# Epic 4: Dynamic Form Rendering

**Goal:** Implement a flexible form rendering system that can display dynamic forms sent from AI agents as JSON, enabling rich interactive data collection within the chat interface.

---

## **Story 4.1: JSON Form Schema Design**
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a standardized JSON schema for dynamic forms,
**so that** AI agents can consistently send interactive forms to the Flutter app.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A comprehensive JSON schema is defined for form structure including:
   - Form metadata (title, description, submission endpoint)
   - Field types (text, number, select, multi-select, date, currency, boolean)
   - Validation rules (required, min/max values, regex patterns)
   - Conditional logic (show/hide fields based on other field values)
   - Styling hints (colors, icons, layout preferences)
2. Schema supports nested sections and grouped fields.
3. Multi-language support for form labels and descriptions.
4. Documentation and examples for each supported field type.
5. Version control for schema evolution and backward compatibility.

## **Story 4.2: Dynamic Form Widget Library**
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a reusable Flutter widget library that can render any form from JSON,
**so that** the chat interface can display interactive forms sent by AI agents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A `DynamicFormWidget` that accepts JSON form schema and renders native Flutter widgets.
2. Support for all defined field types with appropriate native controls:
   - Text fields with input validation
   - Number inputs with formatting (currency, percentages)
   - Dropdown/picker widgets for select fields
   - Multi-select chips or checkboxes
   - Date/time pickers
   - Toggle switches for boolean fields
3. Real-time validation with error message display.
4. Conditional field visibility based on form logic.
5. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
6. Custom styling based on schema hints and app theme.

## **Story 4.3: Form Integration in Chat Interface**
**As a** User,
**I want** to see and interact with forms directly in my chat with the financial advisor,
**so that** I can provide information naturally within our conversation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Chat message type for rendering dynamic forms inline with text messages.
2. Form messages displayed with clear visual distinction from regular text.
3. Form submission triggers API call to specified endpoint.
4. Loading states during form submission with appropriate feedback.
5. Form responses confirmed with success/error messages in chat.
6. Ability to edit previously submitted forms (if allowed by schema).
7. Form auto-save for partially completed forms.

## **Story 4.4: Financial Data Collection Forms**
**As a** User,
**I want** to provide my financial information through guided forms in our chat,
**so that** the AI can better understand my financial situation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Pre-built form templates for common financial data collection:
   - Personal profile (age, income, family size, location)
   - Income sources (salary, freelance, investment, business)
   - Expenses and spending categories
   - Debts (credit cards, loans, mortgages)
   - Assets (savings, investments, properties)
   - Financial goals (short-term, long-term, priorities)
2. Forms sent by Data Collector Agent based on conversation context.
3. Progressive disclosure - forms revealed step by step based on previous answers.
4. Data validation specific to financial inputs (currency formatting, reasonable ranges).
5. Form data automatically saved to appropriate database tables.

## **Story 4.5: Form Analytics and Optimization**
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** to track form completion rates and user interaction patterns,
**so that** I can optimize the data collection experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Analytics tracking for form interactions:
   - Form view/display events
   - Field completion rates
   - Time spent on each field
   - Abandonment points
   - Submission success/failure rates
2. A/B testing capability for different form designs.
3. Analytics dashboard showing form performance metrics.
4. User feedback collection for form usability.
5. Error tracking for validation failures and technical issues.

## **Story 4.6: Advanced Form Features**
**As a** User,
**I want** advanced form capabilities like file uploads and multi-step flows,
**so that** I can provide comprehensive information efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. File upload support for documents (receipts, bank statements, IDs).
2. Image capture integration for taking photos directly from forms.
3. Multi-step form flows with progress indicators.
4. Form branching based on user responses (conditional next steps).
5. Signature capture for agreements or confirmations.
6. Auto-fill suggestions based on previous user data.
7. Form prefilling from existing user profile data.
8. Save as draft functionality for lengthy multi-step forms.
