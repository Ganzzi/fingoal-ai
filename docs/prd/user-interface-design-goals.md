# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be centered on simplicity, trust, and proactive guidance. The design should feel less like a rigid financial tool and more like a conversation with a knowledgeable and approachable advisor. The interface must be clean, uncluttered, and highly intuitive, enabling users to manage their finances with minimal friction and cognitive load.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
*   **Chat-First Interface:** The primary method of interaction will be a conversational UI. Users will perform all actions—from onboarding to transaction logging—through dialogue with the AI.
*   **Dynamic Form Rendering:** The app will seamlessly translate JSON data from the backend into beautiful, native-looking forms within the chat flow. This makes data entry feel like a natural part of the conversation rather than a separate, tedious task.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Users can interact using the most convenient method for them: typing, speaking (voice-to-text), or uploading images for specific tasks like logging receipts.

## Core Screens and Views
The MVP will be hyper-focused on a minimal set of essential screens:
*   **Login Screen:** A simple screen to simulate user authentication for the demo.
*   **Chat Interface:** The main screen where all interactions, data entry, and analysis results are presented.
*   **Profile Screen:** A new screen allowing users to manage their personal profile information and define/edit their spending categories and their allocated budget amounts.

## Accessibility
**Goal:** WCAG AA compliance. While not a primary focus for the hackathon MVP, the design should follow best practices for color contrast, touch target size, and font legibility to ensure a foundation for future accessibility.

## Branding
**Assumption:** The branding for "FinGoal AI" will be modern, clean, and trustworthy. We will use a simple color palette (e.g., blues and greens associated with finance and growth), clear typography, and professional iconography to build user confidence.

## Target Device and Platforms
**Target:** Cross-Platform (iOS & Android) via Flutter. The design must be responsive and work flawlessly on a range of modern mobile device sizes.
