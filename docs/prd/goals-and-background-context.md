# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
*   **Demonstrate a Functional MVP:** Successfully build and present a working mobile app that showcases the core user flow: data input, conversational interaction with the AI, and receiving a meaningful financial analysis.
*   **Validate the Multi-Agent AI Concept:** Prove that the specialized multi-agent system (Intake and Analysis agents) can effectively process user information and provide valuable, context-aware insights within the app.
*   **Showcase Technical Innovation:** Highlight the use of Flutter for the mobile UI, n8n for the orchestrated microservice-style AI workflows, and PostgreSQL for the agent memory mechanism.

## Background Context
FinGoal AI is being developed to address the widespread neglect of personal financial management (PFM) among Vietnam's middle-income professionals. This demographic faces growing financial complexity but is often deterred by the high friction and lack of engaging, holistic guidance from existing tools.

The proposed solution is a chat-centric mobile application that connects users to a team of specialized AI agents. This multi-agent system, orchestrated in n8n, will manage everything from data intake to analysis and interaction, providing a proactive and personalized advisory experience. The core of this project is to prove that this innovative, conversational, microservice-style AI backend can provide a superior user experience for PFM.
