### QA Recommendations
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: None - implementation is production-ready
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Consider adding unit tests for LanguageProvider
3. **LOW PRIORITY**: Add RTL language support detection for future expansion

### Final QA Verdict
**Story 1.7 is fully implemented and exceeds requirements.** The multi-language support is production-ready with:
- ✅ Complete English/Vietnamese localization
- ✅ Persistent language preferences
- ✅ Seamless UI language switching
- ✅ API-ready language context
- ✅ Professional Material Design 3 implementationtween English and Vietnamese,
**so that** I can use the app in my preferred language.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An internationalization (i18n) library (e.g., `flutter_localizations` with the `intl` package) is integrated into the Flutter app.
2. Localization files (`.arb` or similar) are created for both English and Vietnamese with at least 5 sample translation strings.
3. A language switcher UI element (e.g., a toggle or dropdown) is added to the Profile Screen shell.
4. Changing the language updates the sample strings in the UI to reflect the selected language.
5. The selected language ("en" or "vi") is stored in the app's state and is ready to be sent with every API request to the Router Agent.

## Dev Notes

### Flutter Internationalization Requirements
[Source: Flutter documentation]
- **flutter_localizations**: Provides localization of Material Design widgets
- **intl Package**: Handles message formatting and pluralization
- **l10n.yaml**: Configuration file for localization generation
- **.arb Files**: Application Resource Bundle files for translations

### Localization File Structure
**l10n.yaml Configuration:**
```yaml
arb-dir: lib/l10n
template-arb-file: app_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
```

**Sample Translation Strings:**
- App title and branding
- Navigation labels (Chat, Dashboard, Profile)
- Button labels (Login, Edit, Manage)
- Form field labels and hints
- Error messages and status text

### Language Switcher Implementation
**Profile Screen Integration:**
- Add "Language" section below Spending Categories
- DropdownButton or SegmentedButton for language selection
- Immediate language change on selection
- Visual feedback for current language

**Supported Languages:**
- **English (en)**: Default language, primary for international users
- **Vietnamese (vi)**: Primary language for Vietnamese market
- **Future Expansion**: Ready for additional languages

### State Management for Language
**Language Provider Pattern:**
- Use Provider for app-wide language state
- SharedPreferences for persistent storage
- Automatic language loading on app startup
- Reactive UI updates when language changes

### API Integration Preparation
**Router Agent Language Parameter:**
- Include language in all API requests to `/webhook/router`
- Format: `{"language": "en"}` or `{"language": "vi"}`
- Backend uses language for response formatting
- Future AI responses will be in selected language

### Material Design 3 Localization
**Localized Material Components:**
- Date/time formats
- Number formatting
- Text direction (LTR for English, LTR for Vietnamese)
- Accessibility labels and hints

### Testing Considerations
**Localization Testing:**
- Verify all strings are properly localized
- Test language switching functionality
- Validate RTL/LTR text direction
- Check API requests include correct language parameter

### Future Internationalization Features
**Advanced Localization:**
- **Pluralization**: Handle singular/plural forms
- **Gender**: Support gender-specific translations
- **Date/Time**: Localized date and time formatting
- **Currency**: Localized currency display
- **Number Formatting**: Localized number display
