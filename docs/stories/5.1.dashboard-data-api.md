# Story 5.1: Dashboard Data API

**Status:** Ready for Review

**Story:**  
**As a** Flutter App,  
**I want** a comprehensive dashboard API that aggregates all user financial data in a structured format,  
**so that** I can display a complete financial overview including accounts, transactions, budgets, and flexible financial data (debts, investments, savings, goals, insurance) from the JSONB storage system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. Create n8n workflow "Dashboard API" with GET endpoint `/webhook/dashboard` that requires JWT authentication
2. Aggregate data from all core financial tables: `money_accounts`, `transactions`, `budgets`, `spending_categories` 
3. Query flexible financial data from `data_metadata` and `data_rows` tables for debts, investments, savings, goals, and insurance
4. Return structured JSON with calculated financial metrics (net worth, cash flow, budget progress, goal progress)
5. Implement server-side data aggregation and calculations to minimize client processing
6. Add caching mechanism for frequently accessed dashboard data with 5-minute TTL
7. Include proper error handling for missing data, database errors, and authentication failures
8. Follow existing API patterns from spending categories API for consistency

**Tasks / Subtasks:**  
- [ ] Task 1: Create Dashboard API n8n Workflow Foundation (AC: 1, 8)
  - [ ] Create new n8n workflow file `n8n-config/workflows/apis/16_dashboard_api.json`
  - [ ] Set up webhook trigger with ID `dashboard-get-webhook-id` for GET `/webhook/dashboard`
  - [ ] Implement JWT authentication middleware using existing auth pattern from categories API
  - [ ] Add authentication validation and user context extraction from JWT payload

- [ ] Task 2: Core Financial Data Aggregation (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create PostgreSQL node to fetch all user money accounts with current balances
  - [ ] Query recent transactions (last 30 days) with category information using JOINs
  - [ ] Fetch all user budgets with spending category details and current period calculations
  - [ ] Calculate account totals by type (bank, credit_card, cash, investment)
  - [ ] Aggregate transaction data by category and time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)

- [ ] Task 3: Flexible Financial Data Processing (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Query `data_metadata` table to get schema definitions for user's financial data types
  - [ ] Fetch `data_rows` data for each metadata type (debt, investment, savings, goal, insurance)
  - [ ] Process JSONB data according to schema definitions for each financial data type
  - [ ] Calculate derived values (debt payoff timelines, investment performance, goal progress)
  - [ ] Format flexible data into standardized response structure

- [ ] Task 4: Financial Metrics Calculation (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Calculate net worth: sum of all account balances minus total debts
  - [ ] Compute monthly cash flow: income transactions minus expense transactions
  - [ ] Calculate budget progress: spent amounts vs allocated amounts per category
  - [ ] Determine savings rate: savings transactions / total income
  - [ ] Calculate goal progress percentages and projected completion dates

- [ ] Task 5: Response Formatting and Caching (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create JavaScript code node to format comprehensive dashboard response JSON
  - [ ] Implement 5-minute TTL caching using workflow execution metadata
  - [ ] Structure response with overview, accounts, transactions, budgets, debts, investments, savings, goals, insurance sections
  - [ ] Add response metadata with timestamps, data freshness indicators, and API version

- [ ] Task 6: Error Handling and Testing (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement error handling for database connection failures and query errors
  - [ ] Add validation for missing or corrupted JSONB data in flexible storage
  - [ ] Create error response formatting for authentication failures and data access issues
  - [ ] Test with various user data scenarios including empty datasets and missing tables

**Dev Notes:**

**Previous Story Insights:**
No previous dashboard-related stories exist. This is the foundation for financial dashboard functionality.

**Data Models:**
From database schema, core tables to query: [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- `users`: User profiles and authentication data with UUID primary keys
- `money_accounts`: Bank accounts, cards, cash holdings with balance tracking
- `spending_categories`: User-defined expense categories with system defaults
- `budgets`: Budget allocations per category with period and amount tracking
- `transactions`: Financial transactions with category, account, and date information
- `data_metadata`: JSONB schema definitions for complex financial data types
- `data_rows`: Actual JSONB data storage for debts, properties, investments, insurance, savings, goals

**API Specifications:**
From API specification, dashboard endpoint requirements: [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Authentication: JWT tokens required via `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` header
- Response format: Structured JSON with success boolean, data object, and meta information
- Error handling: Consistent error response format with type, message, details, and timestamp

Dashboard data response structure: [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
```typescript
interface DashboardData {
  overview: {
    net_worth: number;
    monthly_cash_flow: number;
    total_debt: number;
    savings_rate: number;
  };
  accounts: MoneyAccount[];
  transactions: Transaction[];
  budgets: BudgetSummary[];
  goals: FinancialGoal[];
  alerts: Alert[];
}
```

**Component Specifications:**
N8n workflow components to use: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, n8n_config_creation_instructions/4-data-processing-nodes.md]
- Webhook trigger node for GET endpoint `/webhook/dashboard`
- Execute workflow node for JWT authentication middleware (reuse existing auth pattern)
- PostgreSQL nodes for database queries with JOIN operations
- JavaScript code nodes for data processing, calculations, and response formatting
- If node for authentication validation and error routing

**File Locations:**
Following project structure: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- New workflow file: `n8n-config/workflows/apis/16_dashboard_api.json`
- Reference existing auth middleware from other API workflows
- Reference existing categories API pattern: `n8n-config/workflows/apis/14_spending_categories_api.json`

**Testing Requirements:**
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs for n8n workflows. Follow patterns from existing workflow implementations.

**Technical Constraints:**
From tech stack requirements: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- PostgreSQL version 15 or 16 for database operations
- JWT token authentication consistency across all API endpoints
- RESTful API patterns via n8n webhook endpoints
- Response caching for performance optimization
