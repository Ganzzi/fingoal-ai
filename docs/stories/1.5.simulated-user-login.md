# Story 1.5: Simulated User Login

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to open the app and log in,
**so that** I can access the main features of the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Login screen is the first screen shown when the Flutter app launches.
2. The screen contains input fields for email/password and both "Login" and "Register" buttons.
3. Tapping the "Login" button navigates the user to the Main App Navigation Shell (from Story 1.4).
4. Tapping the "Register" button shows registration form with email, password, confirm password, and name fields.

## Dev Notes

### Flutter Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **State Management:** Use basic StatefulWidget for this simple login screen
- **Navigation:** Implement clean navigation patterns for app flow
- **Material Design 3:** Use Material 3 components throughout for consistency
- **Form Handling:** Basic form validation without complex state management

### UI Component Specifications
[Source: front-end-spec.md]
- **Login Screen Layout:** Centered form with proper spacing and branding
- **Input Fields:** Material 3 TextFields with proper styling and validation
- **Button Design:** ElevatedButton with primary color and proper sizing
- **Responsive Layout:** Support for mobile and tablet form factors

### Screen Flow Integration
This story establishes the entry point for the application:
- **App Launch:** Login screen is the first screen users see
- **Authentication Flow:** Placeholder for future authentication implementation
- **Navigation:** Directs users to Main App Navigation Shell after login
- **User Experience:** Clean, professional login experience

### Form Field Requirements
**Login Form:**
- **Email Field:**
  - Label: "Email Address"
  - Placeholder: "Enter your email"
  - Keyboard type: email
  - Validation: Email format validation
- **Password Field:**
  - Label: "Password"
  - Placeholder: "Enter your password"
  - Obscured text by default
  - Visibility toggle icon
  - Keyboard type: visiblePassword

**Registration Form:**
- **Name Field:**
  - Label: "Full Name"
  - Placeholder: "Enter your full name"
  - Validation: Non-empty validation
- **Email Field:** (same as login)
- **Password Field:**
  - Label: "Password"
  - Placeholder: "Create a password (min 8 characters)"
  - Validation: Minimum 8 characters
- **Confirm Password Field:**
  - Label: "Confirm Password"
  - Placeholder: "Re-enter your password"
  - Validation: Must match password field

### Navigation Implementation
- **Route Management:** Use Navigator.pushReplacement for clean navigation
- **Transition:** MaterialPageRoute with default transition
- **Back Handling:** Prevent back navigation to login screen after successful login
- **State Preservation:** No complex state to preserve in this story

### Material Design 3 Implementation
[Source: pubspec.yaml dependencies]
- Use `TextField` with Material 3 styling
- Implement `ElevatedButton` with proper theming
- Apply consistent `Theme.of(context)` usage
- Ensure proper contrast ratios and accessibility

### Future Authentication Integration
This story creates the foundation for:
- **Real Authentication:** JWT token-based authentication with n8n backend
- **Password Reset:** Email-based password recovery flow
- **Biometric Login:** Fingerprint/face recognition for returning users
- **Remember Me:** Persistent login state with secure token storage
- **Account Verification:** Email verification for new registrations

### Testing Considerations
- **UI Testing:** Verify form layout and button positioning
- **Navigation Testing:** Ensure proper navigation to main shell
- **Input Testing:** Test keyboard behavior and field interactions
- **Responsive Testing:** Verify layout on different screen sizes
