# Story 1.2: Database Schema Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** an n8n workflow that initializes the database schema,
**so that** the PostgreSQL database is prepared with all the necessary tables for the application to function.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An n8n workflow named "DB Init & Seed" exists in the `/n8n-config` directory.
2. When manually executed, the workflow connects to the PostgreSQL database.
3. The workflow creates all required tables: `users`, `money_accounts`, `spending_categories`, `budgets`, `transactions`, `memories`, `data_metadata`, `data_rows`, `messages`, and `alerts`.
4. The workflow gracefully handles "table already exists" errors to be safely re-runnable.
5. The workflow seeds the database with a default list of spending categories.
6. **Reference:** Follow the n8n workflow patterns documented in `docs/n8n_config_creation_instructions/database-scheme-initialization-workflow-example.md`

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
Based on the unified database schema [Source: architecture/database-schema.md], the following tables must be created with specific structures:

**Core Entity Tables:**
- `users` - User profiles with authentication data (UUID v7 primary key)
- `money_accounts` - Bank accounts, cards, cash holdings
- `spending_categories` - User-defined expense categories
- `budgets` - Budget allocations per category with foreign key relationships
- `transactions` - Financial transactions with proper foreign key constraints

**Flexible Data Storage:**
- `data_metadata` - JSONB schema definitions for complex financial data
- `data_rows` - Actual JSONB data rows for debts, properties, investments, etc.

**Agent Memory System:**
- `memories` - Persistent memory storage for all 9 AI agents (5-7 memories per agent)

**Communication:**
- `messages` - Chat conversation history supporting text, image, and audio types
- `alerts` - User notifications and system alerts

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 or 16
- **Backend Platform**: n8n Cloud/n8n latest
- **Primary Keys**: UUID v7 for time-ordered, globally unique identifiers
- **Data Types**: JSONB for flexible storage of complex financial instruments

### N8N Workflow Patterns
[Source: docs/n8n_config_creation_instructions/database-scheme-initialization-workflow-example.md]
- Use Manual Trigger as workflow entry point
- Implement PostgreSQL nodes with proper credentials
- Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for safe re-execution
- Include schema verification queries
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Structure workflow with clear node connections

### Development Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Workflow should be manually executable for database initialization
- File should be placed in `/n8n-config/infrastructure/01_db_init_seed.json`
- Should integrate with local development setup using Docker PostgreSQL
- Must support environment variable configuration for database credentials

### Critical Configuration Rules
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Environment Variables**: Database credentials must use environment variables, not hardcoded values
- **Error Handling**: Workflow must handle "table already exists" errors gracefully
- **Re-runnability**: Workflow should be safely executable multiple times

### Default Seed Data Requirements
The workflow must seed the database with default spending categories including:
- Food & Dining
- Transportation
- Housing
- Utilities
- Healthcare
- Entertainment
- Shopping
- Education
- Travel
- Insurance
- Savings
- Other

### Testing
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Workflow should include verification steps to confirm successful table creation
- Schema validation queries should check table existence and structure
- Error handling should be tested for connection failures and permission issues
