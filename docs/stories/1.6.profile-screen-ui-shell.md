## Dev Notes

### Flutter Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **State Management:** Use basic StatelessWidget for this static UI screen
- **Screen Structure:** Follow Flutter best practices with proper widget composition
- **Navigation:** Implement clean navigation patterns for app flow
- **Material Design 3:** Use Material 3 components throughout for consistency

### UI Component Specifications
[Source: front-end-spec.md]
- **Profile Screen Layout:** Scrollable content with distinct sections
- **User Profile Section:** Card-based layout with avatar and user info
- **Spending Categories Section:** List-based layout with category items
- **Navigation:** App bar with back button and proper navigation flow

### Screen Flow Integration
This story establishes the profile access pattern:
- **Navigation Source:** Main Navigation Shell app bar icon
- **Screen Purpose:** User settings and preferences management
- **Future Integration:** Foundation for user data management and settings
- **User Experience:** Clean, organized profile interface

### Profile Section Requirements
**User Profile Section:**
- Avatar placeholder (circle with user icon)
- Static user information fields:
  - Full Name: "John Doe"
  - Email: "john.doe@example.com"
  - Phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567"
- Edit button placeholder (non-functional)
- Proper Material 3 card styling

**Spending Categories Section:**

  - Food & Dining (restaurant icon)
  - Transportation (car icon)
  - Shopping (shopping bag icon)
  - Entertainment (movie icon)
  - Utilities (lightbulb icon)
- List item styling with proper dividers

### Navigation Implementation
- **App Bar Integration:** Add profile icon to MainNavigationScreen app bar
- **Navigation Method:** Use Navigator.push for standard navigation
- **Back Navigation:** Automatic back button in app bar
- **Transition:** MaterialPageRoute with default transition

### Material Design 3 Implementation
[Source: pubspec.yaml dependencies]
- Use `Card` widgets for section containers
- Implement `ListTile` for spending category items
- Apply consistent `Theme.of(context)` usage
- Ensure proper contrast ratios and accessibility

### Future Profile Screen Evolution
This story creates the foundation for:
- **User Data Management:** Real user profile data integration
- **Settings Management:** App preferences and configuration
- **Category Management:** Dynamic spending category editing
- **Authentication Integration:** Logout functionality and account management

### Testing Considerations
- **UI Testing:** Verify layout and visual hierarchy
- **Navigation Testing:** Ensure proper navigation from main shell
- **Responsive Testing:** Test on different screen sizes and orientations
- **Accessibility Testing:** Verify proper labels and focus management
