# Future Features & Extensions

## Real-Time Push Notifications
**Implementation:** A lightweight Node.js Socket.io server will be created for real-time push notifications.

**Architecture Flow:**
1. n8n Monitor AI detects alerts or receives bank transaction webhooks
2. n8n processes transaction with Data Collector and Monitor AI agents  
3. If alerts are triggered, n8n makes HTTP request to Socket.io server
4. Socket.io server pushes notification to connected mobile app
5. Mobile app displays real-time alert to user

**Components:**
- Node.js server with Socket.io in `/server` directory
- Mobile app Socket.io client integration
- n8n HTTP request nodes for notification triggers
- Authentication integration between n8n JWT and Socket.io

## Bank API Integration
**Future Integration:** Direct connections to Vietnamese bank APIs for automatic transaction import.

**Process:**
1. Banks send transaction webhooks to n8n endpoints
2. Data Collector AI processes and validates transaction data
3. Monitor AI checks for budget alerts and anomalies
4. Processed transactions stored in database
5. Real-time notifications sent via Socket.io server
6. User receives immediate transaction alerts and insights
