**Flutter Mobile Application**
- Complete UI with Material 3 design system
- AuthWrapper with automatic token validation and refresh
- Login/Registration screens with form validation
- Main navigation shell with chat and dashboard tabs
- Profile screen with settings and categories management
- Chat interface with retry logic, error handling, and message persistence
- Financial dashboard with overview, accounts, budgets, and transactions sections
- Responsive design with loading states and error recovery

**Backend Infrastructure**
- PostgreSQL database with UUID v7 primary keys
- n8n workflow orchestration with webhook endpoints
- JWT middleware for authentication validation
- Database initialization and seeding workflows
- API endpoints for user profile, spending categories, and dashboard data

**Additional Features**
- Bilingual support (English/Vietnamese) via Flutter gen_l10n
- Local notifications system (Flutter Local Notifications)
- Provider-based state management with persistent local storage
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Message retry logic with exponential backoff

### ðŸš§ Partially Implemented

**Dynamic Form Rendering**
- Database schema and infrastructure ready
- JSON form definitions supported
- Flutter rendering components not fully implemented

**Real-time Notifications**
- Local notification system complete
- Firebase integration disabled (code commented out)
- Socket.io infrastructure planned but not implemented

### ðŸ“‹ Architecture Details

**Database Schema**
```sql
-- Core tables implemented:
users, money_accounts, spending_categories, budgets, transactions
data_metadata, data_rows (JSONB storage)
memories, messages, session_states
form_schemas, form_submissions
alerts, notification_preferences, notification_history
```

**API Endpoints**
```
Authentication:
POST /webhook/auth (login, register, logout)
POST /webhook/refresh (token refresh)

Core Application:
POST /webhook/chat (multi-agent chat interface)
POST /webhook/profile (user profile operations)
GET /webhook/dashboard (financial dashboard data)
POST /webhook/categories (spending categories CRUD)
```

**Agent Workflow Files**
```
Infrastructure: 01_db_init_seed, 02_auth_api, 03_jwt_middleware, 04_refresh_api
Agents: 04_intent_session, 05_orchestrator, 06_collect_create_data, 
        07_consult_customer, 08_make_plan, 09_add_changes, 
        10_educate_customer, memory_update_agent
APIs: 14_spending_categories_api, 15_user_profile_api, 16_dashboard_api
```

### ðŸŽ¯ MVP Success Criteria - All Met

1. âœ… **Authentication**: Complete email/password auth with JWT tokens
2. âœ… **Multi-Agent Chat**: 8 specialized AI agents working together
3. âœ… **User Interface**: Polished Flutter app with Material 3 design
4. âœ… **Financial Dashboard**: Comprehensive data visualization
5. âœ… **Profile Management**: Full user profile and preferences system
6. âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and user feedback
7. âœ… **Localization**: English and Vietnamese support
8. âœ… **State Management**: Persistent app state with Provider pattern

### ðŸš€ Technical Highlights

**Innovation Points**

- Seamless integration between Flutter frontend and n8n backend
- JWT authentication system built entirely in n8n workflows
- JSONB-based flexible data storage for complex financial instruments
- Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- Material 3 design with Vietnamese localization

**Code Quality**
- Well-structured Flutter codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Provider pattern for predictable state management
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Responsive UI design with loading states
- Persistent local storage with SharedPreferences
- Type-safe models and API service classes

**Scalability Considerations**
- UUID v7 primary keys for optimal database performance
